# Todo-List
This is an exercise I have done during MERN stack development course of MITxPro. 
This is a simple Todo-List app created using React, React DOM and babel CDNs. ‘useState’ React hook plays an important role in this code. By using this Todo-List app we can add new To-Dos in the input field location by clicking enter button. And also delete unwanted/already done To-dos by clicking  trash can icon present on right side of each list.
# How to Run
To run this code you should need to install <b>node or NVM(Node Version Manager ) </b>in your system
Open the command prompt and give the path of codes residing in the folder.
</br>Run command `http-server -c-1` for starting and http server
</br>Choose one port listed in server details in the command prompt and open it, there you can see the webpage
## Roadmap
I will be adding more codes to this for updating the To-Do list that's already written
